# API

This package contains the GraphQL API for the Frontmen Open Source Contributions web app.

## Getting started

1. Make sure you run `yarn` in the root of the workspace to install all the dependencies of all the packages (including this one).
2. Rename the `.example-env-file` to `.env` and fill in the parameters.
3. To run the API server independently, run `yarn dev` in this folder. To run both the API and the WEB app, please run `yarn dev` in the root of the workspace to run both in parallel.
