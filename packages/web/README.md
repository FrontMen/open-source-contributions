# WEB

A Nuxt web app to show and administrate our open source contributions.

## Getting started

1. Make sure you run `yarn` in the root of the workspace to install all the dependencies of all the packages (including this one).
2. To run the WEB app independently, run `yarn dev` in this folder. To run both the API and the WEB app, please run `yarn dev` in the root of the workspace to run both in parallel. Please note that the WEB server relies on the API running on http://localhost:4000 for its Apollo Client.
